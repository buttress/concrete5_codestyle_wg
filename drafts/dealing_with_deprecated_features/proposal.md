# Dealing with deprecated features

# 1. Summary
The core makes use of methodsa and other features that have been derecated. The code that make use of deprecated features should be refactored to use the replacement code.

# 2. Why Bother?
Features are deprecated because they have become obsolete or their usage is otherwise not recommended. Rather than removing these right away we mark them with a `@deprecated` tag, to provide backward compatibility and also time to bring affected code into compliance with new standards. The goal is to remove the deprecated features eventually.

Removal of deprecated features is impossible as long as the core uses the methods itself. The core using deprecated features sets a bad example for 3rd party developers who might end up following the bad example and also depend on the deprecated code.

# 3. Scope
The scope of this proposal applies to any future version that includes deprecated features, in use by the core.

## 3.1. Release Target
[concrete5 v9.0.0][version-milestone]

## 3.1. Goals

- Remove all usage of deprecated features by the core
- Deprecated methods should be gutted and made to go through new code
- Place helpful comments for how to migrate away
- Remove deprecated features after two major versions of deprecation

## 3.2 Non-Goals

- Removing deprecated features __right away__

# 4. How?

## 4.1. Refactor any code using a deprecated feature
A lot of code can be replaced using search (and replace). Other code might have to be partly rewritten. There will be a fair amount of work required to cleanup for the initial release target. After cleanup affected code should be refactored when deprecating features.

## 4.2. Placing @deprecated tag
Placing the [@deprecated tag][deprecated_tag] clearly marks affected features. Developers can take note of the change and many IDE's support phpDoc as well.

> This tag MAY also contain a version number up till which it is guaranteed to be included in the software. Starting with the given version, the function will be removed or may be removed without further notice.

## 4.3. Refactor deprecated features
Deprecated code should be gutted and made to go through new code at all times with helpful comments for how to migrate away. Only placing `@deprecated` will not be enough.

## 4.4. Removing deprecated features
Remove features that have been deprecated for at least two major versions.

# 5. Examples

The file `/concrete/src/Application/Application.php` contains the deprecated method `PackageList::get()`:
```php
public function setupPackageAutoloaders()
{
    $pla = \Concrete\Core\Package\PackageList::get();
    $pl = $pla->getPackages();
    ...
}
```

Refactored
```php
public function setupPackageAutoloaders()
{
    $pl = $this->make(PackageService::class)->getInstalledList();
```
